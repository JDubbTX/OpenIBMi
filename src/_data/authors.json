		"bio": "My passion is for modernization and open source technologies on the IBM i platform.   Nelnet is a member of the IBM i LUG, or Large User Group.  Through attending LUG meetings, or other conferences like the now defunct RPG and DB2 summit, I have learned quite a bit about modernization of the IBM i platform.  My other passions include adoption and foster care, as well as playing my cello.  At the time of this writing, I've been married to my wife Bekah for 25 years, and I am the father in a large family with 9 kids, almost all of whom are adopted, placed with us in foster care, or we have custody that stemmed from foster care.  My oldest daughter Madelyn is our only natural born progeny, and she is currently living and studying abroad in Madrid, Spain.  Lately I've been been playing my cello for The Theatre Companyâ€™s production of the broadway musical Oklahoma!.",
