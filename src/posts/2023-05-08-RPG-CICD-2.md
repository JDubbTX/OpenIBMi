*This post is continued from [ILE CiCd Pipeline with Gitlab](/2023/05/08/ile-cicd-part-1-create-a-pipeline-with-gitlab).*

There are a few hurdles to overcome to achieve local RPGLE / CLLE development.  This blog post will help you though those hurdles.  The outcome is that changes you make on your local PC pushed to an IFS directory and compiled, while also being synchronized with online source/version control, such as Github, Bitbucket, GitLab, etc.

{% wrap "px-2 mt-8 rounded-lg pb-2 border border-yellow-300 bg-gray-200" %}

To begin, we will not be working on the IBM i.  Instead, we will focus on getting your local PC able to talk to a remote repository hosted in GitLab.  Windows steps are pictured, but the process isn't any different on a Mac.

{% endwrap %}

## VSCODE and Git setup

1. Install VSCODE

   Go to the [Visual Studio Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install it on your machine.  Once installed, it will notify you when there are updates and prompt you to update it, quite seamlessly.   It usually only takes a few seconds.

2. Install GIT (local)

   VSCODE automatically prompts you to download and install it the first time you click on the the **source control** view in the activity bar.  After you finish the GIT install and reload VSCODE, you should see the **Open Folder** and **Clone Repository** buttons in the **source control** view.

   <video src="/assets/video/VSCODE_Install_GIT_2.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls class="object-cover w-full h-full"></video>

3. Configure Git

   The first time you use Git, you must configure some settings.  Open up a bash terminal in VSCODE and run the following 2 commands:

   ``` bash
   git config --global user.name "xx xxxx"
   git config --global user.email "xx.xxxx@mail.com"
   ```

   <video src="/assets/video/Configure_GIT.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls class="object-cover w-full h-full"></video>

   These settings will be used to identify you on every commit you make.

## Set up SSH keys in GitLab

We need to generate an SSH key pair on your local PC, then enter the public key in your gitlab profile.  This allows easy, secure ability to push and pull content from your PC to Gitlab.  All of the following instructions are pretty much the same if you use another SCM like Github instead of Gitlab.

1. Open up a bash prompt on your PC.  If you are in windows, you installed Git Bash when you installed Git.  You could also [install a linux distro like Ubuntu in WSL](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-11-with-gui-support#1-overview).  Gitbash is simpler, but I recommend using WSL if you are interested in using development containers with docker.

2. run `ssh-keygen`, taking the default by pressing enter on each prompt.  Just press enter for the passphrase - you don't need one.  Once you see the randomart image for the key, a key pair was generated in your home directory.

3. Copy the contents of your id_rsa.pub file.  This is your public key that we will register in gitlab or gitlab.  You can display its contents with `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`.  Copy the entire contents, starting with ssh-rsa, ending after the last character displayed.

4. Go into your Gitlab or Github account and register your publish ssh key.

   * [GitLab instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ssh.html#add-an-ssh-key-to-your-gitlab-account)
   * [Github instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

   After public key registration, you will now be able to securely access the remote repository (gitlab / github) using Git over SSH.

## Install VS Code extensions

There are a multitude of extensions available for VSCODE.  They are available to install in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode), or you can access the same marketplace from within the VSCODE in the extensions sidebar view:

   ![Install IBM i Development Pack](/assets/images/InstallIBMiDevelopmentPack.jpg)

Here are the essential ones for IBM i development.

*  [IBM i Development Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HalcyonTechLtd.ibm-i-development-pack) This will install 13 extensions, all helpful for developing on IBM i, including the Code for IBM i extension.

*  [GitLense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens) This gives you full visibility to both the local and remote versions of your git repository.

## Log in to your IBM i with the Code for IBM i extension.

You need to first [configure your Settings](/2023/05/18/VSCODE-Settings-for-IBM-i-development)

## Create a project

There are two approaches to getting a project to sync to online source control.  The easiest approach is to create a blank project online, then clone it locally.  In this tutorial, we will use gitlab, but the same concept applies if you are using Github, Bitbucket, and the like.

In the web browser of your choice, log into your Gitlab account and create a new project.  Think of a good name for your project.  This will end up being the directory name where the source is stored.  For this tutorial we will call it "My First IBM i Project".

<video src="/assets/video/Create_a_Project.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls class="object-cover w-full h-full"></video>

## Clone it in VSCODE

Copy the SSH URL in your GITLAB project and clone it with VSCODE.

1. In Gitlab, click **Code**, and **Clone with SSH**.  This will copy the remote SSH address of your project to the clipboard.

2. Then, in the VSCODE Source Control view, click Clone Repository and paste the SSH address of your project into the prompt and hit enter.

3. Choose a folder to clone the project into.  In this case I clone to *c:/users/jweirich/projects*.  It doesn't matter much where you clone it - you can move it later.

<video src="/assets/video/Cloning_in_VSCODE.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls class="object-cover w-full h-full"></video>

{% wrap "px-2 mt-8 rounded-lg pb-2 border border-gray-300 bg-gray-200" %}

:bulb: In this tutorial, cloning from within VSCODE is demonstrated, but as you get more comfortable with git commands, you may find it easier to clone from the command line.  This can be done from a command line in Gitbash, Windows Powershell, or a WSL/Ubuntu command line.  It doesn't really matter - as long as you have set up your ssh credentials in the same environment and installed GIT correctly it should work.

The command to clone a project from the command line is:

```bash
git clone RepoURL
```

One the project is cloned, you can `cd` into the project directory and enter `code .` to open the project in VSCODE.  Any work done to the project is tracked by Git, and can now be committed and pushed to the remote repository.

{% endwrap %}

5. Set your deploy IFS target directory - do this in the IFS

{% wrap "px-2 mt-8 rounded-lg pb-2 border border-yellow-300 bg-gray-200" %}

In the next series of steps, we will work on the IBM i development partition where source will be built.

{% endwrap %}

## You need a home directory

You need to have a home directory on your development IBM i partition.  It doesn't matter how you add it, there are several ways.  If we assume you can't SSH, you can always do it with a CRTDIR command in the greenscreen.

![Please, not more greenscreen!](/assets/images/CRTDIR.png)

## Set default shell to Bash

If you haven't done it yet, follow instructions in [this link](https://ibmi-oss-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/troubleshooting/SETTING_BASH.html) to set Bash as your default shell.  For historical reasons, IBM i has ksh (kornshell) as the default shell.  Most folks prefer Bash. Most open source examples you find on the web use Bash.  The absolute easiest way to do it is to run the following command in ACS Run SQL Scripts tool:

```
CALL QSYS2.SET_PASE_SHELL_INFO('*CURRENT', '/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin/bash')
```

## IBM i setup.

The first work we need to do is to set up your IBM i profile for open source development.  We will make an SSH connection to the IBM i first, and then we will set up your .profile

</br>

### SSH to your IBM i

You can SSH to your IBM i development partition from a Git Bash prompt, from a WSL/Ubuntu prompt, from Windows Powershell, or from PuTTY.  Which one you use depends on which you are most comfortable with.  I typically use PuTTY, since you can save the connection details and just double click whenever you want to connect.  Quick and easy.  

As you start to spend more time in shell environments, you may find it quicker to SSH from a command line.  You might even want to use an SSH-agent manager, like the one I use - [keychain](https://linux.die.net/man/1/keychain)

The command to SSH is `ssh username@serveraddress`.  If your IBM i server uses a non-standard port, which is the case for PUB400, you must add `-p 9999` to the command, where 9999 is the SSH port number required by the server.

![SSH Options](/assets/images/2023/05/08/SSH-Options.png)

As you can see in the screenshots above, the first time you connect to a server via SSH, you will get a warning message that says something like this:

```text
The authenticity of host '[pub400.com]:2222 ([185.113.5.134]:2222)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:NcBw63NS/aa3kLgyEzg7TMDqp3H4D1q6CLjJfS/FyaE.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
```

This is completely normal the first time you connect.  You can type in `yes`, press enter, and then you be presented with 1) another warning message, 2) the server welcome message and 3) you will prompted for your password.  Enter it and press enter.  

Assuming you followed the steps on this page, including setting up SSH keys on your local machine, setting up a home directory on the IBM i partition, and setting up Bash as the default shell, you should be presented with a Bash prompt in the home directory of you IBM i partition.

It should go something like this:

```text
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[pub400.com]:2222' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

### Setting your IBM i PATH

What is PATH you say?  I think of the PATH environmental variable as something like a library list.  The PATH is simply a list of directories to all the commands and files that you use on a regular basis.  Like a library list, when you enter a Bash command at the bash prompt, the PATH is searched from top to bottom and if the command (or file you are trying to access) isn't found, you will get an error.  

Your IBM i user profile has a default library list defined in its **WRKUSRPRF** profile settings.  We need to do the same thing for your PATH, and that is accomplished by defining it in a special **.profile** file that goes in your home directory.  The awesome open source packages that we want to be able to use are by default installed in the **QOpenSys/pkgs/bin** IFS directory, and so that is the directory we would like to have added to our path.

Perform the following commands:

1. Run `echo PATH=/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin:\$PATH >> .profile` from your home directory
2. Run `cat .profile` to check that the **.profile** file was updated correctly
3. Run `source .profile` to execute the contents of your new .profile file
4. Run `echo $PATH` to check that the PATH environmental variable now includes **/QOpenSys/pkgs/bin**

## Git your code in shape

In this tutorial we are starting from a blank project, but in reality, you probably have some code in Source Files / Members that you would like to track with GIT.  You can copy source members to the IFS using the `CPYTOSTMF` command, and then ftp them locally.  Your organization may have thousands of them.  In this case there are tools that can help with moving source code from IBM i Source Files into the IFS, and then you can download them locally to your PC.  I won't go into detail here because a future blog post will cover options for moving code from source members to the IFS.

This tutorial will use BOB as a build solution, so we will set up our project in a way that BOB requires.

For now We will just add some code to the project, and compile it without using BOB.

The name of the source folders do not matter, but I like to use QRPGLESRC for my ILE RPG source files, QCLLESRC for my ILE CL source files, and QDDSSRC for any display files used in a greenscreen application.

To start, lets add some code to our project - for this tutorial, I'll use a sample greenscreen application that I had chat gpt generate for me, but you can use whatever code you want.  The important thing here is to separate the code into subdirectories, based on logical separation, like language, object type, functional area, etc.  Divide theme in a way that makes sense to you.  

{% wrap "px-2 mt-8 rounded-lg pb-2 border border-gray-800 bg-gray-200" %}

:bulb: **NOTE:** Later these subdirectories may take on more importance, as you can create i-project files in them that specify which target library the object will be created in.  For this tutorial, it doesn't matter much, since all objects will be created in the same library. 

:bulb: **NOTE:** Pay attention to the naming of the source files.  Bob has some specific naming requirements to be aware of.  Most naming rules are self explanatory if you are used to IBM i object types and source member types.  Here are some less obvious rules:

   1. For ILE BND programs, you must include `.PGM` prior to the suffix, otherwise Bob will build a module instead of a program.
   2. RPGLE Include files must have an .RPGLEINC suffix so that Bob does not mistake them for a module or program.

For more information about source file requirements, read the [Bob documentation](https://ibm.github.io/ibmi-bob/#/prepare-the-project/convert-source-code).

{% endwrap %}

The project I'm creating consists of a DDS file that creates a display file, an RPGLE program that uses the display file, a CL program that is called by the rpg program, which sends data to a dataq object that was entered on the screen.

```

/QDTASRC/MYDTAQ.DTAARA

```text
/* Create DTAQ object */
CRTDTAQ DTAQ(MYDTAQ) MAXLEN(20)
```

**Note:** Bob doesn't provide a specific recipe for Dtaq objects, but using the DTAARA recipe works!  That's why this source file is named MYDTAQ.DTAARA instead of MYDTAQ.DTAQ.  There is an [open pull request](https://github.com/IBM/ibmi-bob/pull/281) for Bob to have a dedicated dtaq recipe, but for now this works.

---

At this point you have some source code in files, separated by language, or object type.  You can open up the files with a double-click, and drag them around the editor frame so that they are situated in whatever fashion pleases you.

![Code Examples](/assets/images/2023/05/14/Local-code-examples.png)

## Adding Build Actions

The Code for IBM i extension to VSCODE provides some build actions for local development, but they have to be set up.

1. Press **view**, **command palette**, or **ctl+shift+p**, or **F1** to open the Command Palette.
2. Search for `IBMi: Launch Actions Setup` and click on it.
3. Select the code types you need, along with Bob.

<video src="/assets/video/Code-4-i-local-actions.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls class="object-cover w-full h-full"></video>

After you have set up the local actions for your project, you'll notice a new file has been added to your project, **.vscode/actions.json**.  You can always rerun the Actions Setup if you need to change something, or you can modify the .vscode/actions.json file by hand as well.

{% wrap "px-2 mt-8 rounded-lg pb-2 border border-gray-800 bg-gray-200" %}

:bulb: **NOTE:** The .vscode/actions.json file might not be a file that you want to track with GIT.  You should consider whether or not you should add it to a .gitignore file in the root of your project.  Adding a file to .gitignore means that changes to the file will not be committed, and will not be shared to the remote GIT repository in GITLAB.  That means if you are working on a team, each team member must set up their own version of the .vscode/actions.json file, which might be a *good* thing.  You can read more about the .gitignore file [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

Other entries you should add to your .gitignore are:

**.evfevent/**
**.logs/**
**.env**

{% endwrap %}

## Set Target Deploy location

If you haven't already, in the IFS browser of the Code4i extension, choose an IFS directory that Code 4 i will deploy to.  You can do so by right-clicking on the IFS directory and choosing `Set Deploy Workspace Location`.

You can now run the CRTBNDCL action to compile your CL program.

1.  Make sure the CL program source is active - click your mouse somewhere in the code window for MYFIRSTCL.PGM.CLLE
2.  Press Ctrl+e
3.  Select Create Bound CL Program
4.  Select Changes
5.  All changed source files will be packaged and deployed to the IBM i partition's IFS build directory, and then CRTBNDCL will be run against it.  Results will be displayed in the PROBLEMS view.  If there are any errors, you can click on the error and it will take you directly to the source / line where the error occurred.

<video src="/assets/video/Code-4-i-Action-CRTBNDCL.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls class="object-cover w-full h-full"></video>

Now it seems we are in a good spot.  We can now edit code on our local PC, deploy it to the IBM i, and compile it with just a few steps.  NOT BAD! :sunglasses:

However, problems arise if you try to compile the RPG program.  The RPG program depends on the display file MYDSPF.DSPF.  It won't compile without the display file first having been built.  To make matters worse, none of the built in actions can help us build the display file.  This is because a display file object is built with the CRTDSPF command, and at the time of this writing, CRTDSPF has not been enhanced by IBM to allow building from the IFS.

So what options do we have?  You could resort to using a green-screen 5250 session and build the display file with the help of PDM.  Never!  Fortunately there are alternatives.  We can use Bob :hammer: to build it!  That will be the subject of the next blog post in this series.

But first, lets talk about saving our work with **Git**!

## Committing your code

Before we continue with more development, now would be a great time to do a commit.  As the saying goes, "commit early, and commit often".  As you get used to using Git, remember that the more often you commit your code at well thought out intervals and with good commit messages, the more maintainable your application will be.  At minimum you should commit once a day, but I tend to commit once whenever I finish working on one specific thing.  I try not to mix things in my commits too.  This gives me a specific point in the code history that I can go back to, and even cherry pick changes out of the code if needed.

Before we commit, we need to make a new local branch.  While its fine to commit on the main branch, its best to do your work in another branch if you are doing CiCd.

Its easy to create a branch with the GitLense extension to VS Code.

1. Click on the **Source Control** tab
2. Expand **Branches**
3. Click the Plus button
4. Enter a name for the new branch and press **Enter**
5. Choose **Create Branch and Switch**

<video src="/assets/video/ILE-CICD-CREATE-BRANCH.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls class="object-cover w-full h-full"></video>

If you are interested in the Git command to create a branch and switch to it, it is:

```bash
git checkout -b my-branch
```

Once you are on your new branch, you can **commit** your changes:

1. Save all your work
2. Click on the **Source Control** tab (if needed)
3. Enter a commit message
4. Click Commit.

<video src="/assets/video/ILE-CICD-COMMITTING-CODE.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls class="object-cover w-full h-full"></video>

If you are interested in the Git command to commit your code, it is:

```bash
git commit -m "enter a commit message"
```

{% wrap "px-2 mt-8 rounded-lg pb-2 border border-gray-800 bg-gray-200" %}

:bulb: **Note** One thing I like about VS Code's implementation of Git is its *smart commit* feature.  With *Smart Commit*, you don't have to think about staging your changes prior to a commit, since all saved changes are automatically staged and committed when there are no prior staged changes.  You can still stage files manually if you want to though.  Nifty!

:bulb: **Note** When committing your code, its a good idea to make sure that your commit message is meaningful.  When you commit code, you are adding a record of the changes you made to the project's history.  Its a snapshot that you can actually rewind to (or peek at) in the future if needed.   If you rarely commit, or your commit messages don't have enough meaning to convey what you did, you lose much of the benefit of using Git to manage your source.

{% endwrap %}

## Make it Public

The final step in this post is important.  We need to publish the new branch to the **remote**.  See, when we created a **branch** earlier in VS Code, the branch was only created on your **local** repo.  To get your changes into your **remote** repo (Gitlab), we need to publish it.  

After committing your code on a new branch, there is only one trivial step to do to publish your branch.

1.  Push the **Publish Branch** button.

<video src="/assets/video/ILE-CI-CD-PUBLISH-BRANCH.mp4" autoplay muted loop controls class="object-cover w-full h-full"></video>

What makes this even more simple, is its the same button you pressed to **commit** your code in th prior step.  Publishing happens the first time you **push** code from your local repo to the remote repo on a new local branch:

{% wrap "px-2 mt-8 rounded-lg pb-2 border border-gray-800 bg-gray-200" %}

:bulb: **NOTE:** In the video above, you can see that Gitlab recognizes that a branch has had a new **push**, and asks if you want to do a merge.  This is a time saving feature - typically after you have published the changes you have been working on, the logical next step is often to create a **merge request** (they are called pull requests in github) so that you can get your changes merged to the default branch (main).

:fire: You can also use use a handy shortcut to your remote from within the VS Code **remotes** view.  Its the icon that looks like a planet.
